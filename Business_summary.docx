# Insurance Claim Prediction Model

** Project Overview **
Developed a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to submit insurance claims.
The model aims to help the business improve risk management and pricing strategies by identifying high-risk customers early.

Key Findings
1. Risk Factors
   - Previous vehicle damage is the strongest and most important predictor of future claims.
   - Age shows a non-linear relationship with claim likelihood.
   - Certain regions show significantly higher claim rates.

2. Customer Segments
   - High-risk profile: Young drivers with previous vehicle damage
   - Low-risk profile: Experienced drivers with no previous claims
   - Premium pricing aligns with risk in most cases

3. Model Performance
   - Accurately identifies 43% of all claims
   - Provides confidence scores for all predictions

Business Impact
1. Risk Management
   - Early identification of high-risk policies
   - More accurate premium pricing for customers based on risk factors. 

2. Customer Experience
   - Fair pricing based on actual risk factors
   - Potential for premium discounts for low-risk customers
   - Targeted safety programs for high-risk segments

3. Operational Efficiency
   - Automated risk assessment
   - Data-driven decision making

Recommendations
1. Immediate Actions
   - Review pricing strategy for high-risk customers to ensure accurate premium alignment.
   - Consider expanding data collection to further improve model accuracy, especially for geographic insights

2. Medium-term Initiatives
   - Create customer risk monitoring dashboard
   - Establish regular model retraining process

3. Long-term Strategy
   - Expand data collection for model improvement
   - Develop real-time risk assessment capabilities

Next Steps
- Continue monitoring the model's performance and conduct periodic retraining to ensure accuracy.
